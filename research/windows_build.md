I have successfully completed the refactoring work to prepare the Swordigo Runtime Environment (SwordigoDesktop) for native Windows builds while keeping 100% compatibility with Linux.

Key Accomplishments
Removed POSIX Dependencies: Replaced <dirent.h>, stat(), and access() directory utilities with modern standard C++17 <filesystem> in 
binary_selector.cpp
, 
data_path.cpp
, and the virtual filesystem bridge in 
jni_bridge.cpp
.
Abstracted OpenGL Inclusions: Created 
gl_inc.h
 to solve <windows.h> dependencies under MSVC and replaced raw <GL/gl.h> includes across 7 files.
C Linkage Compatibility: Wrapped declarations in 
asset_manager.h
 and 
log.h
 in extern "C" blocks, fixing the linkage errors when compiling .c files via CMake.
Windows Folder & Process Support:
Updated 
main.cpp
 to use %LOCALAPPDATA% and std::filesystem::create_directories.
Added GetModuleFileNameA and _spawnv for the auto-restart trigger on Windows.
CMake Build System: Created a root 
CMakeLists.txt
 that handles all dependencies on both Linux (via PkgConfig) and Windows (via vcpkg / static libraries).
Verification:
Both make clean && make (Linux Makefile) and cmake --build build (Linux CMake) compile, link, and build 100% successfully.
You can view the full record in 
walkthrough.md
 and the completed checklist in 
task.md
.

When you build on Windows later, you will just need to configure CMake with your package manager (e.g. vcpkg to obtain sdl2, sdl2-image, openal-soft, zlib, libvorbis, and unicorn), and build using the MSVC toolchain! Let me know if you need anything else!

ok this mean, can i now restart n boot windows so i can do this, is it easy?

Yes, you are ready to restart and boot into Windows to build!

Since we set up CMake and migrated all POSIX-specific APIs to standard C++17 library equivalents, the process is very straightforward on Windows.

Here is the exact step-by-step guide to make it easy for you once you boot into Windows 10/11:

1. Prerequisites (If you don't have them yet)
Ensure you have these tools installed on Windows:

Git (to clone or access the codebase partition).
CMake (make sure to check the option to add it to your System PATH during installation).
Visual Studio 2022 (with the "Desktop development with C++" workload checked).
2. Install Dependencies (Using vcpkg)
The most reliable way to get all libraries on Windows is Microsoft's standard package manager, vcpkg.

Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell, and clone + bootstrap vcpkg:
cmd


git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
cd vcpkg
.\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
Install the 64-bit (x64-windows) libraries. Note: Since the guest emulator allocates a 3GB virtual heap for the game environment, compiling as a 64-bit application is mandatory:
cmd


.\vcpkg.exe install sdl2 sdl2-image openal-soft zlib libvorbis unicorn:x64-windows
3. Generate & Build the Project
Open Command Prompt, navigate to your SwordigoDesktop directory:
cmd


cd "D:/path/to/SwordigoDesktop"
Configure the project with CMake, pointing to your vcpkg directory so it finds all libraries automatically:
cmd


cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="C:/path/to/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake"
Compile the production release:
cmd


cmake --build build --config Release
4. Run the Game
Your executable will be located in the build/Release/ directory.

vcpkg automatically copies all dependency DLLs (SDL2.dll, unicorn.dll, openal.dll, etc.) directly into build/Release/ next to your swordigo_boot.exe when it builds!
Just copy your game binaries (libswordigo_nx.so, etc.) and assets / rl_assets folders into build/Release/ (or run it from the root directory specifying --assets and --lib), and launch!
Safe travels rebooting into Windows! Let me know if you run into any compilation questions there.
